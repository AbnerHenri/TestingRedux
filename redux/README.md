# Testing Redux

This repository are for learning the new Redux Toolkit <br>

<h2>This is my observations</h2>

- A new paths organization and a new archive for just the Store
- Each State stay in a new Slice, where stay the reducers that are functions
- Whitin that new Slice exporting the functions and 'Slice.reducer'
- When we use the Dispatch we must pass the funcions with argument
